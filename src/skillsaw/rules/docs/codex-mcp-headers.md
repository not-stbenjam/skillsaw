## Why

Codex's project `.codex/config.toml` uses `http_headers` for literal HTTP
MCP headers and `env_http_headers` for environment-variable names. A
server table carrying `headers` loads, but Codex ignores that field, so
requests omit headers the author intended to send.

This warning checks only `headers` on `[mcp_servers.<name>]` tables with
a string `url` and no `command`. It also reports the ignored field when
`http_headers` is already present or the server is disabled. Other unknown
fields, transport errors, and general server shape validation remain with
Codex. JSON MCP files for plugins and other hosts are outside this rule.

Verified with the released Codex CLI 0.159.3 offline `mcp get --json`
command and its [server configuration parser](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.159.3/codex-rs/config/src/mcp_types.rs).
See the [official MCP documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp)
for supported header fields.

## Examples

Incorrect:

```toml
[mcp_servers.catalog]
url = "https://catalog.example.test/mcp"
headers = { "X-Client" = "release-review" }
```

Correct:

```toml
[mcp_servers.catalog]
url = "https://catalog.example.test/mcp"
http_headers = { "X-Client" = "release-review" }
env_http_headers = { Authorization = "CATALOG_AUTHORIZATION" }
```

## How to fix

Move intended literal header values into `http_headers`, merging with
any existing table. Use `env_http_headers` when values name environment
variables. Remove the ignored `headers` field after reviewing its contents.

There is no autofix: moving the values changes which headers Codex sends,
and existing canonical fields may need a manual merge. The warning is
based on committed configuration; local project trust and user settings
do not suppress it.
